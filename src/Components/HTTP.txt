React and HTTP:
React is a library so it has no concern with HTTP.

How to make AJAX request or make API calls in React?
 => React itself does not have particular way to fetch or send data to the server.
    In fact as fas as React is concerned it doesn't have to even know that there is a server in the picture. React simply read state and
    props and render it to UI.
    To get data from the server you have to get data into your props and state.

If React isn't going to handle the request, then who will?
 => We Use and HTTP library like Axios, fetch API etc.
